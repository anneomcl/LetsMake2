AFTER YOU ARE DONE



1/ Make sure that the game doesn't have any errors

2/ Write a text document (.txt) stating the changes you made (and maybe also some notes, and unfinished work) and put.......
.
......it into the "Build Documentation" folder (which is in the "Builds" folder). //See the folder for examples

3/ If you want future developers to take note of something add it to _ReadThisIMPORTANT.txt in the assets folder

4/ Open _gameVersion.txt (see Assets folder) and change the 'X' in Development Build X by ABC to one more than 'X'.....

.....(for example, Development Build 4 changes to Development Build 5)
 and replace 'ABC' with your twitter username
5/ Build the game and put it into the "Builds" folder, name it dev_build# (Replace # with the version number you changed X to in the previous step)

6/ Send pull request (Put the version number in the title, copy-paste what you wrote into your build documentation into the description).

7/ Send link to the next person in the list



NOW YOU ARE COMPLETELY DONE
